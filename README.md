# Invoice Lector

With this code I was able to read more than 4,500 chilean invoices of 3 years, from where I extracted information of 14,692 items in only 35 seconds.

What kind of analysis could this bill reader be good for?
- Financial
- Accounting (cash flows for example)
- Evaluate price variation
- Find 'bad buys' (and formulate a purchasing strategy based on this)
- Calculate costs and reformulate prices per product sold (and thus improve profitability and competitiveness)
- ... among others
